<p>My favourite character in the whole wide world is BTS.They are the most famous K-pop Boy Band in the entire world.It's not the reason I love them JUST beacuse they are famous, but because they tell people how to Love Yourself, how to Speak Yourself, how to Live your dreams Not other's.So, that;s the reason I love them dearly.They are the best.Another reason I, well not I all ARMIES(Their fandom is named ARMY)love them because of their visuals.Well they are Handsome, no really really Handsome and Cute, I aean really cute.So thse atre the reasons the other ARMIES and i love them very very very much.<p>
